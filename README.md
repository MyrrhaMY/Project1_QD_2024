# Project1_QD_2024
This is a on-going Quest Diagnostics work project based on real world healthcare data of United States from 2016-2020. This project show case my ability to sue SQL for data processing and exploratory data analysis, building timely refresh data pipeline for autorefresh and reflect the data insight using Amazon Quick Sight (AWS) dashboard.

## Future Task:
Prediction model is in preductive and the prediction model will be able to be reflected on the interactive dashboard for clients' need.

## Key Features:
- Interactive dashboard built using AWS Quick Sight.
- Insights of Diabetes trends in United States population from State level to Zipcode.
- Code for data preparation and cleaning in SQL
- Data pipeline built using Matallion ETL

## Preview
